    <h2>II. General Game Issues</h2>
    <h3>Game Crashes</h3>
    <p><b>Game crashes with Metamod installed</b></p>
    <p>Don't install the ordinary Metamod. Instead, install the one from <a href="https://github.com/thephoenixprojectsoftware/metamod">here.</a> (NOTE: This version of Metamod does not work with ordinary listen or dedicated servers. You will need ReHLDS for it to work.</p>
    <h3>LAN Heartbeats</h3>
    <p>By default, the Half-Life game engine now reports the current status of IP LAN (e.g., sv_lan 1 or unable to authenticate) games to the master servers.  This reporting is for general statistical information to Valve only and these IP LAN servers will not be visible to Internet players.  If you would like to opt out of having your IP lan server report to the master servers, you must run the engine or dedicated server with the "-nomaster" command line option.</p>
    <h3>Joystick Functionality</h3>
    <p>The Joystick Functionality in the <i>Half-Life</i> engine is very outdated and only works with joysticks made in the late '90s and early '00s. If you wish to use a controller for playing <i>ZAMNHLMP,</i> you can use the following software solutions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Steam Big Picture Mode:</b> Big Picture Mode on Steam has a functionality where you can make the controller emulate a keyboard & mouse.</li>
        <li><b>Controller Companion:</b> This is a software that <b>Sabian Roberts,</b> the lead developer of The Phoenix Project, uses himself. This software also allows you to emulate a keyboard & mouse with a controller; however, it is paid software and only works with XInput (Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers). Unlike Steam Big Picture mode, it allows you to use your controller on any other program such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Word [using its on-screen keyboard].</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>III. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>Why does the gauss/tau cannon not fire, but the ammo goes down in some multiplayer games?</h3>
    <p>The answer here is <b>ping latency.</b> Try to improve your ping by moving closer to your router, using a wired connection etc., restarting your computer, restarting Steam, playing on a different server or using Ping Enhancement Software.</p>
    <h3>What is the difference between this game and <i>Adrenaline Gamer?</i></h3>
    <p>Quite a few. For example, there is a massive set of maps, easier accessible menus, more and modified gamemodes, reanimated playermodels, viewroll, viewmodel bob tilt, and a few extra goodies.</p>
    <h3>Why can I see incomplete parts of the weapons' viewmodels?</h3>
    <p>Simple answer: <b>FOV.</b> You can change the FOV of the firstperson view by opening the console (set the control in Keyboard settings), typing <code>default_fov</code> in the command line and then the value of your choice. The minimum is 20 and the maximum is 150. The default value is 110. Though it is declared in the userconfig.cfg file, the value is also hard-coded into the game.</p>
